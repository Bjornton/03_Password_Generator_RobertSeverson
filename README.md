# 03_Password_Generator_RobertSeverson

For this week's homework assignment, we were required to modify starter code and create an application that generates a 
random password. The starter code was the index.html file and the style.css file. All of the work was put into the script.js
file. The user must first put in a number between 8 and 128, signifying how long they want their password to be. Then a series
of yes/no questions, in the form of Ok/Cancel prompts will be shown asking the user what they want their password to contain. 
It offers uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It will randomly disperse these four options into a
viable password. In the images folder, you can find 3 screenshots that show the working code in action.
